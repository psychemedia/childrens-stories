The Old Woman and her Pig

An old woman was sweeping her house, and she found a little crooked sixpence, "What," said she, "shall I do with this little sixpence? I will go to market, and buy a little pig."

As she was coming home, she came to a stile: but the piggy wouldn't go over the stile.

She went a little further, and she met a dog. So she said to the dog: "Dog! bite pig; piggy won't go over the stile; and I shan't get home to-night." But the dog wouldn't.

She went a little further, and she met a stick. So she said: "Stick! stick! beat dog! dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile; and I shan't get home to-night." But the stick wouldn't.

She went a little further, and she met a fire. So she said: "Fire! fire! burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over the stile; and I shan't get home to-night." But the fire wouldn't.

She went a little further, and she met some water. So she said: "Water, water! quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; pi^y won't get over the stile; and I shan't get home to-night." But the water wouldn't.

She went a little further, and she met an ox. So she said: "Ox! ox! drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't bum stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't i get over the stile; and I shan't get home to-night." But the ox wouldn't.

She went a little further, and she met a butcher. So she said: "Butcher! butcher! kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; uuiiiicbmcktriuouidni. piggy won't get over the stile; and I shan't get home to-night." But the butcher wouldn't.

She went a little further, and she met a rope. So she said: "Rope! rope! hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox won't drink water; water won*t quench fire; fii won't burn stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bit pJg y piggy won't get over the stile; and I shan't get horn to-night." But the rope wouldn't.

She went a little further, and she met a rat. So sh said: "Rat! rat! gnaw rope; rope won't hang butcher butcher won't kill ox; ox won't drink water; wate won't quench fire; fire won't burn stick; stick won' beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggy won't get over th stile; and I shan't get home to-night." But the ra wouldn't.

She went a little further, and she met a cat. So sh( said: "Cat! cat! kill rat; rat won't gnaw rope; rop< won't hang butcher; butcher won't kill ox; ox won' drink water; water won't quench fire; fire won't bun stick; stick won't beat dog; dog won't bite pig; piggj won't get over the stile; and I shan't get home to-night* But the cat said to her, ** If you will go to yonder cow and fetch me a saucer of milk, I will kill the rat." So away went the old woman to the cow.

But the cow said to her: "If you will go to yondei hay-stack, and fetch me a handful of hay, I'll give you the milk." So away went the old woman to the haystack; and she brought the hay to the cow.

As soon as the cow had eaten the hay, she gave the old woman the milk; and away she went with it in a saucer to the cat.

As soon as the cat had lapped up the milk, the cat began to kill the rat; the rat began to gnaw the rope; the rope began to hang the butcher; the butcher began to kill the ox; the ox began to drink the water; the water began to quench the fire; the fire began to burn the stick; the stick began to beat the dog; the dog began to bite the pig; the little pig in a fright jumped over the stile; and so the old woman got home that night.
